# Initial Capstone Proposal
The goal of our Capstone projects is to create a foundation of code on which various strategies can be built and tested. We derive our inspiration from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Dr Marcos Lopez de Prado. The proposed project will deliver an open source package and implementation of the strategies from which the research community can build upon.

## About the Project
The Capstone course is the culmination of the student?s academic and professional experience in the Master of Quantitative Finance with Focus on Alpha Generating program. Over the during of this course, students will apply their knowledge gained during the program, integrating the skills necessary for analyzing issues, thinking creatively, working collaboratively, and presenting impactful alpha generation strategies to create a Capstone Project. The Capstone Project will leverage all aspects of Quantitative Finance taught in the course of the program ? technical, fundamental, behavioral etc and hopefully should be one of the most aspirational pieces of work a student completes in his or her career.
